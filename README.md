    - I struggled with trying to import JS Font awesome, however managed to stick it through and get the issue resolved.

    - Similar issue with Lighthouse. Lighthouse scores were poor, managed to score better when switching to incognito mode. Chrome extensions had an affect on website's performance score.

- Conducted user testing with friends and family members.
    - Users enjoyed the sites visuals however later found out that the visuals were taking too much space and were too large. This resulted into compressing the image files which led to the decrease in somme image quality.

- Getting into the habit of commenting when submitting any changes to the site allowed me to better document the changes I made when creating the site. 
- Using terminal to pull and push my repository.

# Home:
- The first page created was the Home page as I believe it was the most important as it's the first page someone see when checking out a website. The banner used in the header section of the Home page is designed to be responsive depending on different devices.

    - I tested out the Homepage with 3 individuals. Each individual was excited to find out more about the brand and enjoyed how Little Wins navigation was different from other sites making them intrigued to check all the pages out. 
    - The first individual to test the site realised it took a while too load, I assumed it was there internet connection however later found out with using lighthouse that the image files we're too large especially the main banner. 
    - The main banner's resolution was sacrificed in order to get the a better lighthouse score.
    - The banner in place now is a good resolution for Laptop screens, 13-15inchs, however when using a high resolution Desktop you are able to see the pixelation.
    - The home page continue to introduce the brand to new and existing users, again with a thought provoking Title. 
    - Moving down the page, it follows a steps process which theme is carried on throughout the Website journey. (A user mentioned this whilst testing) maintaining the rule of 3, one of the Brand's main values.
    - Including a great quote by a respectable historical figure, to help users who are just quickly browsing to understand the Little Win's brand values.
    - Finishing off with the brand's values and mission statements, giving more details about the brand, followed by a Join the Community section to lead users to other spaces where Little Wins is available to be contacted.

# Process:
- The Process page aims to touch more on the idea of Little Wins and what it represents. Little Wins represents breaking tasks into smaller digestiable tasks in order to achieve more, whether that be in business or with professionals.

    - The process page is to continue and break down the brands Visions and Missions which ended on the Home page.
    - Starting off with the Brand's Values and Mission on this page was to allow users to be briefly recapped on what Little Wins the brand focuses on achieving and how the brand's values can help achieve this. 
    - Again with more useful information on tips and tricks to help new users, and frequent users keep up to date with suggested approaches to tacking individual or business goals.
    - The 3 step process contiues Little Brand's theme of simplicity using the rule of 3 to break down the steps. 
    - Including the theme of finishing the page with an oppurtunity for new and frequent users to keep up with the Little Win's brand community via Social Media.

# Goals:
- The Goals page 
    - The goals page aims to have a goal of getting individuals to reachout to Little Wins to learn more and get in contact with the team.
    - I used accessibility for less abled users to help with the navigation of all pages, indicating which sections are which and giving them a brief description for all section.
    - The contact form at the bottom acts also as a query section to allow users to directly contact Little Wins via the website.
    - Finishing off with the Join the Community section which acts as a footer through out the whole site.
